Some simple and quick code to allow you to delete mass amounts of messages in a group wall on the platform Roblox. This was made due to many people asking for ways to do this on the DevFourm and also many feature requests. This code is written in JavaScript (node.js).

### How to use?

*If you wish to use this code I recommend checking out how to use this below:*

1) Clone the code inside of this respository. You can do this by clicking the green "Code" button and then clicking the "Download Zip"; after that you will be required to extract the zip file. You can also use commands inside of the command prompt (or other way if your not on the windows OS). Also ensure you have node.js install onto your device (can get download from node.js website).

2) After this fill in all of the values inside of the .env file (all values in the .env file are required). Please also ensure that all values you add are vaild and correct or you may have issues when attempting to start up the Discord bot. An explaination of the values can be found on the DevFourm post.

3) Next download all of the NPM packages which are required for this Discord bot to work. You can do this by writing **``npm install``** inside of the terminal/command prompt (or other way if your on a diffrent OS).

4) If everything above is suscessfull and you receive no issues above you can now run the code. You can do this locally via running **``node .``** inside of the terminal/command prompt (or other way if your on a diffrent OS). Once completed it should stop running and no errors should come in the terminal; a common error you might get is Roblox not allowing the request due to a rate limit, this is nothing I can fix and is Roblox defense against DDOS attacks so you may need to wait a few mins somtimes.

**If you follow all steps above you should be able to set up the Discord bot. You can get support on the Roblox DevFourm post or by contacting LifeDigger#4510 on Discord.**
